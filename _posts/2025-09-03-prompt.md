Given your role as an AI developer, you should approach prompt design with an engineering mindset, treating it as a core component of your code. A prompt is no longer just a simple command; it's a key parameter used to control and coordinate the behavior of a Large Language Model (LLM).


# 1. Structure your prompts: Treat your prompt as a structured API request, not just a block of text.

- System Message:*Define the model's core role and rules.*
- Tool Definitions:    *Explicitly list available tools and their functions.*
- User Input:         *Dynamically embed the user's question.*
- Output Constraints: *Specify the exact output format (e.g., JSON).*

# 2. Use an engineering mindset:

- Version Control:      *Store prompts in a codebase and use Git.*
- Parameterization:     *Use variables to avoid hard-coding.*
- Logging & Monitoring: *Log prompts and responses for debugging.*
- Automated Evaluation: *Build test suites to check performance.*
- Edge Cases:           *Test for abnormal or tricky inputs.*
